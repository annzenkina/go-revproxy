# Go Reverse Proxy Load Balancer

A health-aware round-robin load balancer written in Go that intelligently distributes incoming HTTP requests across healthy backend servers with automatic health monitoring and graceful failure handling.

## Features

- **Health-aware load balancing**: Automatically skips unhealthy servers and distributes requests only to healthy ones
- **Round-robin distribution**: Evenly distributes requests across available healthy servers
- **Automatic health checks**: Configurable interval (default 5 seconds)
- **Request-level retry logic**: Automatically retries failed requests on different healthy servers (up to 3 attempts)
- **Real-time failure detection**: Immediately re-checks server health when requests fail, doesn't wait for next health check cycle
- **YAML configuration**: Flexible configuration management via `config.yaml`
- **Health monitoring endpoint**: Real-time health status via `/healthz` API endpoint
- **Graceful failure handling**: Returns appropriate HTTP errors when all servers are down or all retries fail
- **Request logging**: Comprehensive logging of requests, health checks, retries, and server status changes
- **Concurrent health checking**: Non-blocking parallel health checks for optimal performance
- **Rate limiting**: Token bucket per client IP; configurable capacity and reset interval

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- Podman (for running backend servers)

#### Installing Podman

If you don't have Podman installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install podman
```

For detailed installation instructions, visit the [official Podman installation guide](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).

### Running the Application

**First, set up and start the backend servers using Podman:**
```bash
make up
```

This command will start the backend servers using Podman containers, then run the reverse proxy.

**Alternative manual steps:**

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

2. **Run the proxy:**
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   ```bash
   # Test load balancing
   curl http://localhost:8080/hello
   
   # Check server health status  
   curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
   ```

### Testing Backend Servers

You can test individual backend servers:

```bash
make call-server1  # Test server on localhost:9001
make call-server2  # Test server on localhost:9002  
make call-server3  # Test server on localhost:9003
```

### Configuration

The application uses YAML configuration via `config.yaml`. Copy `config.example.yaml` to get started:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

Example configuration:
```yaml
listen: ":8080"
routes:
  - prefix: "/server1"
    target: "http://localhost:9001"
  - prefix: "/server2" 
    target: "http://localhost:9002"
  - prefix: "/server3"
    target: "http://localhost:9003"
healthCheckInterval: 5s
rateLimitTokenCapacity: 5
rateLimitResetInterval: 1m
```

Config keys:
- `healthCheckInterval`: How often to run backend health checks (e.g., `3s`, `10s`). Default: `5s`.
- `rateLimitTokenCapacity`: Max tokens per client bucket. Default: `5`.
- `rateLimitResetInterval`: How often buckets reset to full capacity (e.g., `30s`, `1m`). Default: `1m`.

## How It Works

1. **Health Monitoring**: At a configurable interval (default 5s), the load balancer checks all backend servers concurrently
2. **Request Handling**: Incoming requests to `/hello` trigger the health-aware load balancer
3. **Healthy Server Selection**: Only healthy servers are considered for load balancing
4. **Round-robin Distribution**: Requests are distributed evenly among healthy servers using an atomic counter
5. **Request Forwarding**: The request is proxied to the selected healthy backend server
6. **Real-time Retry Logic**: If a request fails (server went down between health checks):
   - Immediately triggers a health check for the failed server
   - Automatically retries the request on the next healthy server (up to 3 attempts total)
   - Updates server status in real-time without waiting for the next health check cycle
7. **Failure Handling**: If all servers are unhealthy or all retries fail, returns HTTP 502 Bad Gateway
8. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of health checks, server status changes, request routing, and retry attempts

## Load Balancing Pattern

The load balancer uses a health-aware round-robin algorithm:
- **Only healthy servers receive traffic**
- If all servers are healthy: Request 1 â†’ Server 1, Request 2 â†’ Server 2, etc.
- If Server 2 is unhealthy: Request 1 â†’ Server 1, Request 2 â†’ Server 3, Request 3 â†’ Server 1, etc.
- **Automatic recovery**: When unhealthy servers recover, they're automatically included in rotation

## API Endpoints

- **`/hello`** - Load-balanced endpoint that forwards requests to healthy backend servers
- **`/healthz`** - Health monitoring endpoint that returns JSON status of all backend servers

Example health check response:
```json
[
  {"url": "http://localhost:9001", "healthy": true},
  {"url": "http://localhost:9002", "healthy": false, "error": "connection refused"},
  {"url": "http://localhost:9003", "healthy": true}
]
```

## Example Output

```
2024/01/01 12:00:00 listening on :8080, forwarding based on config
2024/01/01 12:00:00 Health checks available at /healthz

2024/01/01 12:00:07 Info: Server http://localhost:9003 responded with HTTP 200 (non-JSON), treating as healthy
2024/01/01 12:00:08 Request: forwarding /hello to http://localhost:9003 (attempt 1)
2024/01/01 12:00:10 Request failed to http://localhost:9001: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:9001: connection refused (attempt 1/3)

2024/01/01 12:00:15 CRITICAL: All servers are down! Load balancer entering failure mode.
2024/01/01 12:00:20 RECOVERY: Servers are back online! Load balancer operational again.
